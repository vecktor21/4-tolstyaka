  To copy project you have to:
  <ol>
    <li>in CMD choose directory where you want to install this project</li> 
    <li>copy this in CMD: <b>"git clone https://github.com/vecktor21/4-tolstyaka.git"</b></li>
    <li>install modules from packaje.json using "npm i"</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>main Node JS script is located in server-side-script.js floder</p>
<p>most likely you will not be able to start server because it's data base is into localhost</p>
