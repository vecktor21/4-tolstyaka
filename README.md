  To copy project you have to:
  <ol>
    <li>in CMD choose directory where you want to install this project</li> 
    <li>copy this in CMD: <span style="font-family: Consolas">git clone https://github.com/vecktor21/4-tolstyaka.git</span></li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>main Node JS script is located in server-side-script.js floder</p>
<p>most likely you will not be able to start server because it's data base is into localhost</p>
